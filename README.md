# Hittastic
This is a second year PHP project making the hittastic music site.

This is a site we built over multiple weeks of lectures and labs to learn how to use PHP and completing certain tasks along the way. The server used to make the site can't currently be accessed so this repository is just to show the code, not any live project.
The styling of the site and its contents was pre-decided by the lecturer.

The site itself is a music site that allows users to search for their favorite songs by simply typing the artist or by doing an advanced search, the homepage also contains an AJAX search.

The results page allows users to 'purchase' downloads of the songs or buy a quantity of the CD, they can also go to a youtube search for the song.

The site contains a full login system with admins and normal users, restricting access to the site based on the login status and admin status. Users can signup and change their password if they need.

Each user has a balance they can use to buy downloads and CDs, they can't download or purchase CDs if they have no balance or the quantity of CDs runs out.

There is an admin console to update all information in a song.
